          People from all social classes attend college, a good portion of whom
          are fresh out of high school or have traveled a long way to attend
          college. The atmosphere of a college campus can be a bit chaotic,
          since there are a lot of people who are in a new environment. Colleges
          put a lot of effort into creating a warm and welcoming environment to
          make it easier on the student body. Most students and teachers have
          limited time between classes which can make it a stressful experience
          trying to get to their next class. At EvCC the campus has been
          upgraded one piece at a time which has created a disjointed
          atmosphere.

          A learning environment is more than just a classroomâ€”it's a space in
          which students feel safe and supported in their pursuit of knowledge,
          as well as inspired by their surroundings. Think back to some of the
          classroom environments you've encountered on your educational path.

        <h3>
          The computers in computer labs are typically equipped with internet
          access, scanners, and printers and are typically arranged in rows.
          This is to give the workstation a similar view to facilitate lecturing
          or presentations, and also to facilitate small group work.
